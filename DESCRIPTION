Description: StreamPULSE is a community of researchers working to
    answer fundamental questions about ecosystem production and
    respiration in streams and rivers. The StreamPULSE project
    (streampulse.org)
    includes online tools for viewing, archiving, and cleaning data
    submitted by researchers from around the globe. It leverages 
    metabolism modeling frameworks streamMetabolizer
    (https://github.com/USGS-R/streamMetabolizer) and BASE
    (https://github.com/dgiling/BASE). This package facilitates 
    data acquisition from the StreamPULSE database, data
    supplementation where necessary, formatting for streamMetabolizer
    or BASE, as well as model fitting and prediction.
